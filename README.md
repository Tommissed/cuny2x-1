Further notes in the folder, but this is my first attempt of Unity and Project management, making sure we did finish a game within our 3 day timeframe, even though the programmers had 0 experience with Unity at all. There was a lot of cut corners, and one bug, but the game runs and we are very proud of it considering we only had 3 days to complete the whole thing.

Everything regarding code is completely made by me. Our homeworks revolve around doing something in adobe photoshop or illustrator and our professor makes us display it on our websites, but there is no code or assistance on how our web pages should look like.
