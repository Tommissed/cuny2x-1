Further notes in the folder, but this is my first attempt of Unity and Project management, making sure we did finish a game within our 3 day timeframe, even though the programmers had 0 experience with Unity at all. There was a lot of cut corners, and one bug, but the game runs and we are very proud of it considering we only had 3 days to complete the whole thing.
