THIS PROJECT IS CREATED FROM SCRATCH FOR GLOBAL GAME JAM, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY CLASS OBLIGATED RESPONSIBILILTIES.
This is a global game jam project that was split up between 5 people. 
	Kyra did sounds, Melanie did assets and visuals, while the rest of us did the code. 
	Josh did animations (When the character moves, it plays a walking animation).
	Estabon did UX stuff like the main menu, scene transitions, and other stuff.
	I implemented the music into each scenes, and did the grabbing script. 
Problem was we did not have enough time to fully debug our code, so I did not have enough time to fix a bug in the grab script.
However, the game still runs and plays. Considering that this is our first game while and first times using Unity, We are proud of what we made.
